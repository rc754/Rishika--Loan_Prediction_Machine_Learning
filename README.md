# Loan_Prediction_Machine_Learning

With the enhancement in the banking sector lots of people are applying for bank loans but the bank has its limited assets which it has to grant to limited people only, so finding out to whom the loan can be granted,
which will be a safer option for the bank is a typical process. We introduce an effective prediction technique that helps the banker to predict the credit risk for customers who have applied for loan. By predicting the loan
defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non-Performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important.

## Problem Statement
There is a company named Dream Housing Finance that deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the
customer eligibility for loan. However doing this manually takes a lot of time. Hence it wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer information.So the final thing is to identify the factors/
customer segments that are eligible for taking loan. How will the company benefit if we give the customer segments is the immediate question that arises. The solution is . . . .Banks would give loans to only those
customers that are eligible so that they can be assured of getting the money back. Hence the more accurate we are in predicting the eligible customers the more beneficial it would be for the Dream Housing Finance
Company.
